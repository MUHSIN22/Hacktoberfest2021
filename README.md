## Guide to Hacktoberfest

- Fork the repo to contribute 
- Clone on your local machine

```terminal
git clone (copy link from the code and paste)
cd Hacktoberfest2k21
```

- Create a new branch

```markdown
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```
- Add your contribution
- Commit and push

```markdown
git add .
git commit -m "your-commit-msg"
git push origin my-new-branch
```

- Create a new pull request from your forked repository


## Avoid Conflicts (Syncing your fork)

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   

```terminal
git remote add upstream (copy link from the code and paste)
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing
```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run
```terminal
git merge upstream/master
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo.
